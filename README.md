# inkling

## Description

Inkling is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to one another's thoughts, and create a friend list. Inside Inkling's UI, user's are known as 'Squids' and a Squid's thought is known as an 'inkling'. Inkling is built using a NoSQL database.

## Installation

Since Inkling is currently only a server-side API, in order to explore it's use you will need to clone the code onto your local machine to get started. Using your local machine's command line, move into the root directory of the code and run `npm i` in order to install the applications dependencies. From there, you should only need to run `npm start` in order to start up the application. However, in order to access the application's server a program such as Insomnia will be needed in order to view the returned data.
